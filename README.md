## Setup

`npm ci`

## Building

`npm run build`

## Parsing (generate report)

`npm run convert -- -s <SCAN_RESULT>`

Where `SCAN_RESULT` is the path to the JSON output generated by `lw-scanner`. Optionally, you may supply the location
via the `SCAN_RESULT` environment value and omit the `-s` argument.

Optionally specify the name/location the report file is written to

* Default the output is written to `./report.sarif.json`
* Can be set using the `-o` argument or via `SARIF_OUTPUT` environment variable



Other arguments:

* `-d` or `CUSTOM_DOCKERFILE_NAME` env var: When globbing the project for docker files, if using a non-standard name supply with this
    var
* `-p` or `PROJECT_ROOT` env var: What is the base location that should be searched, relative to your source code, for docker file.

>Note: Currently only the first dockerfile found is processed.  TODO: Process all.
